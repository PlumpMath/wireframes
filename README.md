# Wireframes [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rm-hull/wireframes.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rm-hull/wireframes)

A lightweight 3D rendering engine in Clojure & ClojureScript.

![Torus](https://raw.github.com/rm-hull/wireframes/master/doc/gallery/solid-torus.png)

Ported from javascript (see references below) into ClojureScript (that will
render to SVG or an HTML5 Canvas), and Clojure (that will render to a Graphics2D object
or SVG).

## Usage

### Creating shapes

There are some drawing primitives in the ```wireframes.shape``` namespace to create
objects such as circles, cuboids, cylinders and torus shapes.

The basic mechanism for building shapes is *extrusion*. For example, to create a cube, 
start with a point, and extrude that point into a line along the Z-axis. Then extrude
that line along the Y-axis to create a square; extrude the square along the X-axis to
create a cube, as per the following code:

```clojure
(->>
  (make-point 0 0 0)
  (extrude (translate 0 0 1))
  (extrude (translate 0 1 0))
  (extrude (translate 1 0 0)))
```

### Drawing shapes

There are various software renderers in the ```wireframes.renderer``` namespace for
output to java images, SVG or HTML5 canvas (the availability of which combinations
depends on whether you are executing the code in Clojure or ClojureScript).

#### Clojure

For example, in Clojure, to generate a torus angled in the Y- and Z-axles, written
out to a PNG file:

```clojure
  (write-png
    (->img
      3
      (concat
        (rotate :z (degrees->radians 65))
        (rotate :y (degrees->radians -30))
        (translate 0 0 16))
      (make-torus 1 3 60 60)
      [400 400])
    "torus-65.png")
```
Produces:

![Torus](https://raw.github.com/rm-hull/wireframes/master/doc/gallery/torus-65.png)

The defacto/clichÃ©d Utah teapot (or any patch/vertex 3D file) can be loaded in with the following
code sample:

```clojure
(write-png
(->img
  10
  (t/concat
    (t/rotate :z (sp/degrees->radians 35))
    (t/rotate :x (sp/degrees->radians -70))
    (t/translate 0 -1 40))
  (sl/load-shape "resources/newell-teapot/teapot" 16)
  [600 600])
"teapot.png")
```
which generates:
