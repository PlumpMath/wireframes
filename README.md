# Wireframes [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rm-hull/wireframes.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rm-hull/wireframes)

A lightweight 3D rendering engine in Clojure & ClojureScript.

![Aventador](https://raw.github.com/rm-hull/wireframes/master/doc/gallery/translucent/aventador.png)

Adapted and extended from a javascript demo (originally by Kragen Javier Sitaker, see references below) 
into a ClojureScript/Clojure library (that will render to SVG, an HTML5 Canvas or a Graphics2D object 
depending on the runtime environment).

A variety of (in-progress) generated wireframe and solid shapes can be found 
in the [gallery](https://github.com/rm-hull/wireframes/blob/master/GALLERY.md).

### Pre-requisites

You will need [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 2.3.2 or above installed.

### Building

To build and install the library locally, run:

    $ lein test
    $ lein cljsbuild once
    $ lein install

To re-generate the examples in the ```doc/gallery``` directory, run:

    $ lein test :examples

### Including in your project

There *will be* a version hosted at [Clojars](https://clojars.org/rm-hull/wireframes). For leiningen include a dependency:

```clojure
[rm-hull/wireframes "0.0.1"]
```

For maven-based projects, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>rm-hull</groupId>
  <artifactId>wireframes</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Basic Usage

### Creating shapes

There are some drawing primitives in the ```wireframes.shapes``` namespace to create
objects such as circles, cuboids, cylinders and torus shapes.

The basic mechanism for *building* shapes is **extrusion**. For example, to create a cube, 
start with a point, and extrude that point into a line along the Z-axis. Then extrude
that line along the Y-axis to create a square; extrude the square along the X-axis to
create a cube, as per the following code:

```clojure
(->
  (make-point 0 0 0)
  (extrude (translate 0 0 1) 1)
  (extrude (translate 0 1 0) 1)
  (extrude (translate 1 0 0) 1))
```

### Drawing shapes

There are various software renderers in the ```wireframes.renderer``` namespace for
output to java images, SVG or HTML5 canvas (the availability of which combinations
depends on whether you are executing the code in Clojure or ClojureScript).

#### Clojure

For example, in Clojure, to generate a torus angled in the Y- and Z-axles, written
out to a PNG file:

```clojure
(write-png
  (->img
    (draw-solid
      {:focal-length 3
       :fill-color (Color. 255 255 255 0) ; transparent white
       :transform (concat
                    (rotate :z (degrees->radians 65))
                    (rotate :y (degrees->radians -30))
                    (translate 0 0 16))
       :shape (make-torus 1 3 60 60)})
    [400 400])
  "torus-65.png")
```
Produces:

### Loading common 3D shape files

The defacto/clichÃ©d Utah teapot (or any patch/vertex 3D file) can be loaded in with the following
code sample:

```clojure
(write-png
  (->img
    (draw-solid 
      {:focal-length 10
       :fill-color (Color. 255 255 255 128) ; translucent white
       :transform (t/concat
                    (t/rotate :z (sp/degrees->radians 35))
                    (t/rotate :x (sp/degrees->radians -70))
                    (t/translate 0 -1 40))
       :shape (sl/load-shape "resources/newell-teapot/teapot")})
    [1000 900])
  "teapot.png")
```
which generates:

## TODO

* ~~Efficiently calculate polygons on extruded shapes~~
* Rewrite/rename wireframes.transform/concat - unroll loops for performance
* ~~Complete Bezier patch code~~
* ~~Rectilinear perspective mapping~~
* ~~Stitch adjacent surface panels together~~
* SVG renderer
* Canvas renderer
* ~~Simple flat shading / lighting~~
* Configurable lighting position(s)
* Colours
* Gourand shading
* Texture mapping
* ~~Backface removal~~
* Compute shape bounds
* gcode generation for 3D printers
* Support loading from & saving to .stl files
* ~~Support loading from Wavefront .obj files~~
* Deprecate ```:lines``` - no longer used except in platonic solids
* Improve documentation
* Examples

## Known Bugs

* Bug in shader/lighting position - affected by applied transforms?
* Improve depth criteria for priority fill/painters algorithm
* Cube (multi-dimension) extrusion is generating erroneous polygons
